# Wegstatus Polyline Selector
Adds a link in the segment-panel to grab the polyline. 

## In this update:
1. Multi segment support
2. Import for Wegstatus website.

## Use carefully!
When using the multi segment function, please make sure you select the segments in the right order. The combined polyline must be from A to B. After pasting the polyline into the inputbox, click the button and the coordinates for the start and end locator will change (the map will not be updated yet). Click 'save'. 
If the polyline is not correct, try to select the segments the otherway around in the WME and redo the steps. When failing again, this have to be done segment by segment.
